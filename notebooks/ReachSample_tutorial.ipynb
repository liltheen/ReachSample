    "### This tutorial is intended to familiarize a new researcher with both visualizing the ReachMaster robot workspace, as well as the process of generating new commands. This tutorial walks through visualization, generation, and analysis of experiments where a researcher chooses commands manually or command positions within discrete spatial dimensions of task. For more information on the ReachMaster system and how to use it, please visit our ReachtheDocs page at https://reachmaster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.\n",
